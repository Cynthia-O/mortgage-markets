#download Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data from https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/explore
#filter Select year(s) of data:2017 [later other focal years]
#drop-down "Select suggested filters" to "All originated mortgages (modified)
#drop-down "LOAN" navigate to "What is the loan being used for?" toggle "Home purchase" + "Refinancing"
#alternatively in dplyr with full data set "filter(loan_purpose_name%in%c("Refinancing","Home purchase"))"
#but big data set is already big; better to tailor download
#LENDER filter would be great, but FFIEC's disclosure tool still broken as of 20181022
#leave all other settings default
#chunky files ~4-7 GB each; allow time for downloads

#download 2016-2017 US Census data from https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/state-total.html#par_textimage
#select census "Population, populatio change, and estimated components of population change: April 1,2010 to July 1, 2017 (NST-EST2017-alldata)"
#less than 1 MB; census data downloads fast

#title HMDA data as HMDA[year] - depends on year you downloaded
#this script currently handles one HMDA year at a time
#title Census data as Census - will include multiple years
#I retitled focal Census fields with titles I like to type more, e.g. "pop_est_2017" replacing "POPESTIMATE2017"
#load necessary packages:
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

#join census and HMDA2017 data by their one shared variable - state_name:
levels(HMDA2017$state_name);levels(census$state_name) #they don't match up - more factors in census than HMDA2017, and "" in HMDA
setdiff(levels(HMDA2017$state_name),levels(census$state_name));setdiff(levels(census$state_name),levels(HMDA2017$state_name))

#tidy up census data by removing some state-level names that aren't present in the HMDA data
#then dropping ghost levels that linger after dplyr filters
#shouldn't need to do this again for additional HMDA data, if HMDA is consistent in state_names from year to year
census<-census%>%

setdiff(levels(HMDA2017$state_name),levels(census$state_name));setdiff(levels(census$state_name),levels(HMDA2017$state_name))
#character (0) twice = looks good!

#join the two files
HMDA_census_2017<-inner_join(census,HMDA2017,by=c("state_name"="state_name"))
#that makes a huge file... need to track down a way to just join by state_name and pull pop_est_2017 along
